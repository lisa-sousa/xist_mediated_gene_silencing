### Abstract
To initiate X Chromosome inactivation (XCI), the long non-coding RNA Xist mediates chromosome-wide gene silencing of one X Chromosome in female mammals to equalize gene dosage between the sexes. The efficiency of gene silencing is highly variable across genes, with some genes even escaping XCI in somatic cells. A geneâ€™s susceptibility to Xist-mediated silencing appears to be determined by a complex interplay of epigenetic and genomic features; however, the underlying rules remain poorly understood. We have quantified chromosome-wide gene silencing kinetics at the level of the nascent transcriptome using allele-specific Precision nuclear Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). We have developed a Random Forest machine learning model that can predict the measured silencing dynamics based on a large set of epigenetic and genomic features and tested its predictive power experimentally. The genomic distance to the Xist locus, followed by gene density and distance to LINE elements are the prime determinants of the speed of gene silencing. Moreover, we find two distinct gene classes associated with different silencing pathways: a class that requires Xist repeat A for silencing, which is known to activate the SPEN-pathway and a second cluster where genes are pre-marked by Polycomb complexes and tend to rely on the B repeat in Xist for silencing, known to recruit polycomb complexes during XCI. Moreover, a series of features associated with active transcriptional elongation and chromatin 3D structure are enriched at rapidly silenced genes. Our machine learning approach can thus uncover the complex combinatorial rules underlying gene silencing during X inactivation.

### Structure of the repository
The repository has two main folder: *data* contains all data needed to perform the analysis done in the paper; *scripts* contains the analysis pipeline and is structured into four parts according to four main analysis steps, each analysis step is structured into a seperate folder:

#### fit_silencing_halftime
This folder contains two scripts that are used to compute half-times for each gene. 

- *fit_halftimes.R*: computes half-times for the PRO-seq and mRNA-seq (undifferentiated and differentiated) data set; takes as input the allelic ratio from the PRO-seq/mRNA-seq experiment and the Gencode M9 gene annotation; this script was used to craete Figures 1D-F and 2A

- *6_normalize_ChIP_data_with_normr.R*: this script is used to calculate the normalized enrichement scores in a window specified for each chip-seq feature (e.g. 500 bp around TSS or gene body); it takes as input a bed file with gene annotation, the input directories for chip and control experiments as well as a metadata file where the chip-seq name (e.g. CTCF), the GEO number, file name of experiment and control, the # of bp upstream of TSS (variable name in script: a), the # of bp downstream of TSS (variable name in script: b) (for gene body specify either a=NA and b=x which means from TSS to x bp downstream OR gene end if x is longer then the gene; or specify a=NA and b=NA for whole gene body); binsize for normR normalization (needs to be adapted to the width of the chip-seq peak, e.g. 1000-1500 for broad peaks and 250-750 for narrow peaks) are defined
